                <p class="text-faded">The Center for Extrasolar Planetary Systems (CEPS), founded in 2012 as part of SSI's long-term strategic plan, is a consortium of SSI researchers from different fields who have a mutual interest in studying extrasolar planetary systems.  The CEPS mission is to apply a multidisciplinary approach in conducting fundamental scientific research that increases our understanding of the characteristics of extrasolar planets and the diverse systems in which they are found. Because the exoplanet field by nature transcends traditional discipline boundaries, CEPS brings together astronomers, physicists, chemists, geologists, atmospheric scientists, planetary scientists, and remote-sensing experts to foster interdisciplinary collaborations and provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and expertise.  Current theoretical and observational research focus areas for the center include (1) the chemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres, (2) the properties of planet-hosting stars, (3) the influence of the host star on the planet and/or system characteristics, (4) the formation and evolution of planetary systems, and (5) the signatures of planetary formation as reflected in disk systems.  CEPS members continually seek innovative ways to explore this exciting new astronomical frontier.</p>
